%p Welcome to Wavrr. %p Wavrr helps amateur athletes find teams to join, and teams to find their next player.%p We started Wavrr because - as team organizers - we were spending more time and effort fielding teams that we were actually playing the game. While we have many goals for what Wavrr will become, right now it’s a place where team managers can fill out their rosters and keep everyone up-to-date on team activities.%p If you're a team captain, you can organize your roster and find individuals to join your team based on experience level, position and location. If you're an athlete without a team, here's where you can find the team with the appropriate level of play for your talents.%p Please try out Wavrr and let us know what you think! <a href="mailto:team@wavrr.com?Subject=Feedback">
